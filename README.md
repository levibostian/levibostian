## Yo, so glad you're here! 

My name is Levi (they/them) and I love writing open source software. 

I began writing pushing my code to the public in 2013 while in University. Although I was very nervous, I created my first pull request to the [LearnXinYMinutes.com GitHub repo](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs). After eventually becoming one of the core contributors, I contributed and maintained the project from 2013-2015. 

If you want to hear the full story, I was [profiled in Red Hat's opensource.com](https://opensource.com/life/14/7/my-open-source-world) where I shared how I got into open source development. 

# Most active open source projects 

These projects are projects that contain a large amount of contributions from myself: 

- [LearnXInYMinutes.com](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs) (2013-2015)
- Customer.io mobile SDKs - [iOS](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-ios/), [Android](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-android/), [React Native](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-reactnative), [Flutter](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-flutter/), [Expo](https://github.com/customerio/customerio-expo-plugin/) (2021-2024)

One of my favorite parts of open source development is opportunity to share ideas and offer help with projects that you love. I have been active in a few communities over the years that received some fun recognition I am proud of: 

- **Realm.io MVP member** - 1 of 12 members in world to be recognized from using the Realm mobile database SDKs and offering help to the community. 
- Profiled in **[Fabric.io (Twitter)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/flpc6ct5iv2yklz/Fabric%20Blog%20%7C%20Build.%20Understand.%20Grow..pdf?dl=0) & [Red Hat's opensource.com](https://opensource.com/life/14/7/my-open-source-world)**

# Shout-outs! 

Although these projects may not be projects I continuously come back to work on, they have a special place in my heart and I enjoy sharing them with others. 

- [dollabill](https://github.com/levibostian/dollabill-apple) - *Easily* integrate your backend server with Apple in-app purchases. I created this tool after spending countless hours learning StoreKit and writing the backend code to verify transactions and enable renewable subscriptions for an app. This tool would have cut my time and stress to a fraction. 

- [I love writing GitHub Actions](https://github.com/levibostian?tab=repositories&q=github+action) and [plugins for semantic-release](https://github.com/levibostian?tab=repositories&q=semantic-release)! Any of those are fun little projects. 

- [Automated code signing maintenance for all of our iOS apps](https://github.com/customerio/apple-code-signing) - Tool that provides all developers and CI servers code signing files they need to sign iOS apps. All files protected behind Google authentication and files automatically renewed every 6 months to keep unblocked. 

- [binny](https://github.com/customerio/binny) - Assert that everyone (including CI) are running the same development tools, on the same version. Designed as a fast alternative to [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) that installs pre-built binaries compared to building from source code. 

- I have a new project that's a WIP that I am very excited about. If you enjoy tools such as semantic-release to automate your code deployments, I encourage you to [watch this project](https://github.com/levibostian/new-deployment-tool). 

# Interests outside of code... 

When not writing code, I have some other interests I enjoy...

- Long distance running 
- Outdoor rock climbing 
- Remodeling my house
- Being a parent and a spouse ðŸ«¶
- Getting creative inspiration by playing an indie video game

Peace and love, Levi
